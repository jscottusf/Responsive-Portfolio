                My first experience with coding was in 1999 building simple HTML websites on Angelfire. It was something of a nerdy habit for a sixth grader, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Over the next few years, I used my HTML skills to build simple websites on topics ranging from punk rock bands to NFL football. However, I became distracted by other pursuits in life, not thinking much of the opportunities that existed in the field of Computer Science.

                For the past nine years I have working as a public school teacher. My experience includes eight years teaching US History and Holocaust History for Strawberry Crest High School (Hillsborough County Public Schools) and one year teaching eigth grade Social Studies for Wendell Middle School (Wake County Public Schools, North Carolina). My career so far in public education has been highly rewarding. I enjoy collaborating with others and helping people to grow and reach their full potential. So now I am seeking new opportunities, looking to put my collaboration and presentation skills to work along with aquiring new skills in order to solve problems. This is what ultimately has brought me back to coding and why I am now pursuing a new career in tech.

                I started programing again in the fall of 2018 after learning about an organization called Launchcode 101. My goal was to prepare myself in order to apply for their next free coding bootcamp in Tampa. I started off by watching some YouTube tutorials in order to write some very simple progams using C. In the time since then, I have written multiple basic programs using C, Python, and JavaScript along with expanding my coding knowledge through HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, the second Launchcode 101 never did come to Tampa. In August, I learned about the UCF coding bootcamp and immediately began making plans to enroll, which brings me to where I am now.

                I enjoy the challenges and problem solving that comes with programming and often find myself getting lost in time while writing code. I am really excited about taking on this new opportinity and I am looking forward to working professionally in the field of Computer Science.
